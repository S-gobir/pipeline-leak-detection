 # Pipeline Leak Detection Model

This repository contains the code, trained model, and documentation for detecting pipeline leaks by identifying **gas** and **water leaks** using deep learning. The model was developed using the **Ultralytics YOLOv8** framework, trained on a dataset sourced from Roboflow.

---

## Project Overview

Pipeline leaks can lead to significant environmental and financial consequences. This project aims to develop a robust object detection model to detect leaks by identifying gas and water emissions. The trained model can be integrated into monitoring systems to prevent major pipeline failures.

### Key Features
- Detects gas and water leaks in pipelines.
- Achieves high precision and recall, making it suitable for real-world applications.
- Built on the YOLOv8 architecture for fast and efficient detection.
